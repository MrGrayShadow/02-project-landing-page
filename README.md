<h1>Project: Landing Page</h1>

The goal of this web development project is to create a landing page that utilizes the concepts learned thus far in <strong>The Odin Project</strong>.  These elements are:
<ul>
	<li>HTML</li>
	<li>CSS</li>
	<li>Flexbox</li>
</ul>

The website will be organized into three files: <em>index</em>, <em>style</em> and <em>README</em>.  The landing page will follow the style guidelines outlined by the assignment.  The website will contain four main sections in addition to a header and a footer.  

The site will be designed for <mark>larger screens</mark>, since learning how to design sites for mobile devices will not come until later in the program.
